## **GCP Foundation – Cloud / Infrastructure Engineer**
**Technology / Platform:** Google Cloud Platform
**Role:** Cloud / Infrastructure Engineer
**Level:** Foundation → Intermediate
**Total Duration:** 16 Hours

---

## **Course Overview**

This accelerated, role-based program builds **practical, production-oriented proficiency** in core GCP services used by Cloud and Infrastructure Engineers.

Participants move from **core concepts** (IAM, networking, compute, storage) to **intermediate operational skills** such as autoscaling, observability, governance, and cost visibility.

The course emphasizes:

* **Least-privilege IAM**
* **Infrastructure reproducibility (CLI-first mindset)**
* **Production-grade networking & security**
* **Monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting**
* **Cost awareness and governance alignment**

By the end, learners can **provision, secure, operate, and observe workloads on GCP confidently**.

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing this program, learners will be able to:

* Design and provision **secure VPC networks** with subnets, routes, and firewall rules
* Implement **IAM best practices** using roles, service accounts, and identity boundaries
* Deploy and operate **Compute Engine workloads**, including templates, MIGs, and autoscaling
* Configure **Cloud Storage** with lifecycle rules, versioning, and encryption
* Set up **Cloud Monitoring & Logging**, create alerts, and debug incidents
* Apply **governance controls** such as labels, Org Policies, and KMS
* Build and demonstrate a **VM → Cloud Storage integration** using least-privilege access

## **Session 1 – GCP Fundamentals & Resource Hierarchy**

* Overview of Google Cloud Platform services
* Global infrastructure: regions, zones, multi-region design
* Resource hierarchy: Organization, Folder, Project, Resource
* GCP project lifecycle and environments (dev, test, prod)
* Shared Responsibility Model (Google vs Customer)
* GCP Console, Cloud Shell, and gcloud CLI overview
* Basic project setup and navigation

**Outcome:**
Understand **how GCP is structured and operated at an enterprise level**.

---

## **Session 2 – Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

* IAM concepts and core terminology
* Users, groups, and service accounts
* Roles: primitive, predefined, custom
* IAM policy structure and inheritance
* Least-privilege access design
* Service account usage patterns for workloads
* IAM audit logs and access troubleshooting

**Outcome:**
Design and implement **secure, least-privilege access control** in GCP.

---

## **Session 3 – VPC Networking Fundamentals**

* VPC architecture (global VPC, regional subnets)
* Default VPC vs custom VPC
* Subnets and CIDR planning
* Routes and internet access
* Firewall rules: ingress, egress, tags, service accounts
* Private vs public IP addressing
* Connectivity validation and basic troubleshooting

**Outcome:**
Design and secure **network connectivity for cloud workloads**.

---

## **Session 4 – Compute Engine & VM Operations**

* Compute Engine overview and use cases
* VM types and sizing strategies
* VM images, snapshots, and disks
* Startup scripts and metadata
* Instance templates
* Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)
* Autoscaling concepts and health checks

**Outcome:**
Provision and operate **scalable, resilient VM-based workloads**.

---

## **Session 5 – Cloud Storage & Data Management**

* Cloud Storage architecture and use cases
* Bucket configuration (location, storage class)
* IAM at bucket and object level
* Object versioning and retention
* Lifecycle management rules
* Encryption options (Google-managed keys, CMEK overview)
* Secure access from Compute Engine to Cloud Storage

**Outcome:**
Securely store and manage **object data with durability and governance**.

---

## **Session 6 – Observability, Security & Governance**

* Cloud Monitoring overview
* Metrics, dashboards, and alerts
* Cloud Logging and log exploration
* Logs-based metrics and alerting
* Basic troubleshooting workflows
* Labels and tagging for cost visibility
* Organization policies overview
* Security hardening and operational best practices

**Outcome:**
Operate workloads with **visibility, security, and governance controls**.

---

## **Lab 7 – Capstone Project**

* **Internal Resource Dashboard** – Multi-service integration
* Combines: VPC, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, IAM, Monitoring, Logging
* Real-world use case: Content managed in Storage, served by VM; IT updates without touching servers
* Production-ready: Labels, alerts, dashboards

**Outcome:**
Demonstrate end-to-end **deployment of a secure, observable application** on GCP.

---

## **Lab 8 – Capstone Project (HA)**

* **High-Availability Web Service** – Load balancing and zone resilience
* Combines: Custom VPC, 2 VMs (MIG), HTTP Load Balancer, Health Checks, Monitoring
* Real-world use case: Customer-facing status portal; survives zone/VM failure
* Production-ready: Single entry point, automatic failover

**Outcome:**
Demonstrate **high-availability deployment** with load balancing and multi-zone resilience.

---

### **Program Completion Skills**

By the end of these 6 sessions (plus capstone), participants can:

* Provision secure GCP infrastructure
* Deploy and manage VM workloads
* Control access using IAM best practices
* Store and manage data securely
* Monitor, troubleshoot, and govern cloud environments
* Build and integrate multi-service solutions (capstone)

If you want next, I can:

* Add **session-wise lab titles**
* Map sessions to **GCP Associate Cloud Engineer exam**
* Convert this into **PPT/LMS-ready format**
* Add a **mini capstone aligned to Session 4–6**
